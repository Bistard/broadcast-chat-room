# broadcast-chat-room
This is a basic chat room using Socket, which supports mutiple clients on the server to communicate to each other.

## instruction
> $ git clone https://github.com/Bistard/broadcast-chat-room.git  
> $ cd broadcast-chat-room/dev  
> $ make

Now, you can either do `./main client` or `./main server` to be either client or server. By default, running `./main` is running as server.
